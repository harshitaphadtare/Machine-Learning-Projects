# movie recommender system
The following steps outline the methodology behind the Movie Recommender System:

<b>Data Collection</b> - Gather comprehensive data on movies, including attributes such as genre, plot summaries, and other relevant features.

<b>Vectorization</b> - Transform movie descriptions into high-dimensional vectors using advanced vectorization techniques. This step ensures a numerical representation of textual data for efficient analysis.

<b>Stemming</b> -  Apply stemming to each word in movie descriptions, reducing them to their root form. This process simplifies the comparison of textual information and improves the system's ability to identify commonalities.
